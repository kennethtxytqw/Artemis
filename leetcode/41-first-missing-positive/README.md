Winner -> Solution 2

## Solution 1

Space Complexity = O(n)
Time Complexity = O(n)
Every element will only be resorted at most once. And we will be going through the list twice

## Solution 2

Space Complexity = O(1)
Time Complexity = O(n)
Every element will only be resorted at most once. And we will be going through the list twice
